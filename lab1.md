Cd:
Cd with no argument, when we call "cd" with no specific argument it means that we are calling something like the "default directory", or home directory. When we run the cd command, it doesn't output anything. We can use cd as a great tool to take us back to the original starting directory from wherever we are in the system (Image 1).
